# Voice Interface (Alexa Skills) - Summer Camp

*Voice Interface (Alexa Skills) summer camp lessons and materials.*  

The slides have been updated with the newest UI for the Alexa Skills Kit ([developer console](https://developer.amazon.com)) [and AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). The pdf version is found in this repositor, `deck_pdf_version.pdf`, as well as *reveal.js* (deck/index.html).  

To use the reveal.js, clone this repository and open `index.html`, which will run in the browser. Alternatively, to use the .pdf version, just open `deck_pdf_version.pdf`.  

**Note:** I will update the sample code the slides/deck point to; in order to make it easier for students to follow along (and copy/paste) considering the new UI.  

## Starting the Same Alexa Skill & Lambda Function Code  

After the class is logged into the developer console and aws console, have them all start with copying the same code for the Lambda function and the same *intents* and *utterances* for the skill itself. Both are found in the slides/deck. The first goal is to get everyone to the point of a working skill (i.e. no errors when testing). From here, students can customize the skill and Lambda function to make it their own. Lastly, the class can work indivudally or in teams to create a separate skill, or continue with the template.
